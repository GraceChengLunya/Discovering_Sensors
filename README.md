# Discovering_Sensors
Problem Statement: Smart homes are equipped with a variety of wireless sensors that monitor activities and environmental conditions. 
These sensors operate using different communication protocols, such as BLE, WiFi, or Zigbee. 
However, identifying and locating these sensors without prior knowledge of their exact locations or functions is a challenge
especially when considering grey assets â€“ devices not controlled by us. 
A systematic method to discover and locate these sensors using RF signals could enable improved automation, monitoring, and even security/privacy.

Project Goal: Design a system capable of autonomously discovering and identifying wireless sensors in a smart home, 
assuming that the sensors use one of the common communication protocols (e.g., BLE, WiFi, Zigbee). 
By analyzing RF signals, MAC addresses, and communication protocols, the system will pinpoint the locations and analyze the functions of these sensors. 
Once discovered, the sensors can be mapped to a floor plan, providing insights into their physical positions within the environment. 
The focus will be on identifying grey assets and classifying their functions, enhancing both the understanding of device distributions and potential privacy concerns.
